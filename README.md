Project api twitch the freecodecamp
The Twitch API is a RESTful API that lets developers build creative integrations for the broader Twitch community.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]

UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ instead of Twitch's API base URL and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
